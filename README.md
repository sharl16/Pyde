## An attempt at making a simple IDE based solely on Python.
Turns out Python is NOT the ideal language to use for this job.

A few issues I encountered while trying to conquer this:
- A plethora of questionable bugs, probably due to the way Python is interpetered..
- Unstable code execution, debugging Python with Python is not advised :)
- Graphical Issues, Tkinter is not really intended to be used outside of prototypes..
- Performance Issues ðŸ¤·

This project had been left on hold for more than a year, so it is safe to say this project will no longer be maintained.
Archival date is May 7, 2025 - but that was after a cleanup sweep I did that I remembered this repository's existance :/, 
the repository was abandonded well before that date..
